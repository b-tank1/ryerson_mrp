# ryerson_mrp - selling AAPL put spreads

Pre-requisites: install yfinance and stockstats python packages <br>
<br>
Project Overview: develop neural network model to predict optimal entry and exit signals for selling put option spreads on AAPL.<br>
<br>
Notebooks Included: Each notebook involves sample experimentation with different parameters (e.g. number of nodes, batch size, iterations, regularization, dropout, etc.)<br>
<br>
Pending Enhancements: implement hyper-parameter tuning libraries to optimize re-running model under different parameters. Currently taking relatively brute force approach.
